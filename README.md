## How does it work?

The `examples` directory contains a directory for each environment. Those examples work independently and gives you access to some command to have the result of the examples they give.
Each example environment supply a `README.md` to give more context and more informations.

To be able to try the examples, you will sometimes need to have setup a Specify repository and generate a personal access token. So that you can try every examples only from a single repository and a single personal access token, the `.env` file is in the root directory and will be used in the examples.

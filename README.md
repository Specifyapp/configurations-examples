# Configurations examples

## What is Specify?

Specify helps you unify your organization's brand identity at scale by collecting, storing and distributing design tokens and assets ‚Äî automatically.

See Specify as a design API helping organizations manage their branding within their design system.
## What is this repository?

This repository helps you configure Specify and define a custom transformation pipeline for your design data. Find in this repository ready to use Specify configurations on specific environments (e.g. Style Dictionary, CSS Variables, Tailwind, Theme UI...).

Bootstrap pipelines to synchronize and transform your design tokens and assets in seconds.

üëâ Feel free to clone the repository to customize those configurations as you wish.

This example repository helps you understand how to combine and configure Specify's parsers with real-world examples.

## How does it work?

The `/examples` directory contains a directory for each environment. Those examples work independently from each other. Each of them give you access to some commands to help you get the same output they present.
All examples are detailed by their own `README.md`.

## What is the .env file?
We recommend you to store and use your personal access token thanks to an `.env` file.

‚ÑπÔ∏è You will only be able to use this `.env` file inside a Specify configuration written in JavaScript.

However, Specify can have its configuration is JSON if:
- You want to
- Your configuration is meant to be used inside a Github repository
